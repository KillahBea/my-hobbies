    <h1 class="My Hobbies">I love Succulents!</h1>
    <p>Succulents are an easy plant to work with if you know how to treat them right!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your soil should be well-draining; excessive moisture will likely cause rot and fungus among
        us.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most succulents are light loving and require sunlight; however, the darker the leaf the more
        shade tolerant the plant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Know your seasons! Like bears, succulents "hibernate". You will water your plant babies more
        often during the growing season and limit their dihydrogen monoxide in the winter months.
      </li>
      <li>Plants gotta eat, too! Like you, a plant requires nutrients to flourish.</li>
    </ul>
